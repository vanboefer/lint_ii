## Introduction

- **LiNT-II** analyzes Dutch text readability using four linguistic features: word frequency, syntactic dependency length, information density (number content words per clause), and proportion of concrete vs abstract nouns. [*Read more*](#linguistic-features)
- **LiNT-II** outputs a readability score between 0-100; the higher the score is, the more difficult the text is. The scores can be mapped to four difficulty levels: a text of Level 1 is understandable for about 85\% of adult Dutch readers, while a text of Level 4 is understandable for about 18\% of adult Dutch readers. [*Read more*](#scores-and-diffculty-levels)
- **LiNT-II** scores and levels are based on an empirical comprehension study, where understanding of different texts was assessed using a *cloze test* (fill-in missing words). The study involved 120 texts; 2700 Dutch high-school students participated. [*Read more*](#lint-and-lint-ii)

## Demo

Select one of the 4 texts below to see the detailed LiNT-II analysis:

- The upper bar shows the score and difficulty level for the whole document.
- Click on ∑ (right-upper corner) to see additional document-level statistics.
- On the text itself, you can see the difficulty level per sentence; hover above it to see additional sentence-level statistics.
- Hover above each word to see the word-level linguistic features, like word frequency, semantic type, etc. To understand the features and how they are calculated, see [Linguistic Features](#linguistic-features).

**Notes for the design**:
- Upper bar: sentences, document score, document level
- Hover on sent stats: OK
- Hover on word stats: freq tier in the original LiNT:
    - erg laag < 1.5 (minder dan 32 keer voor per miljard woorden)
    - 1.5 <= laag <= 3 (tussen de 32 en 1000 keer voor per miljard woorden)

## LiNT and LiNT-II

### Background and motivation

**LiNT-II** is a new implementation of the original **LiNT** tool. 

LiNT utilizes the legacy NLP pipeline [T-Scan](https://github.com/CentreForDigitalHumanities/tscan) to extract linguistic features from text; this software is difficult to install and to run and is therefore not suitable for many use cases.

LiNT-II is a modern Python package, with [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) under the hood. It can be easily installed with [`pip`](https://pypi.org/project/pip/), and integrated into other software; it is fast and therefore suitable for production setups.

In order to preserve the scientific integrity, we worked in close collaboration with Henk Pander Maat, one of the researchers who developed the original LiNT.

### Original LiNT

The first version of LiNT was developed in the NWO project *Toward a validated reading level tool for Dutch* (2012-2017). Later versions were developed in the *Digital Humanities Lab* of Utrecht University.

More details about the original LiNT can be found on:

- [LiNT (Gebruiker Centraal)](https://www.gebruikercentraal.nl/hulpmiddelen/lint-leesbaarheidsinstrument-voor-nederlandse-teksten/)

The research on which LiNT is based, including the empirical comprehension study and the development of the model, is described in:
